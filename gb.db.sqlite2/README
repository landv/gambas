(Daniel Campos <danielcampos@netcourrier.com> ) - All float values has been replace
by double values, as some extra wrong decimals were added in conversions from sql data
types to Gambas data types.

Uses the STL and requires the sqliteclient library. Currently tested with
SQLite 2.8.13. from www.sqlite.org

sqlite is typeless...although in the create you can specify type details (these are
just comments!).  These types have been defined to map to gambas, those not defined
will default to string.

Database/Gambas Type : ft_String/ GB_T_STRING
DDL Value : BLOB, CHAR(, CLOB, TEXT, VARCHAR, ENUM, SET, YEAR, Non specified

Database/Gambas Type : ft_Boolean/ GB_T_BOOLEAN
DDL Value : CHAR, TINYINT, INT1, BOOL

Database Type/Gambas : ft_Short/ GB_T_INTEGER
DDL Value : SMALLINT, INT2, MEDIUMINT

Database/Gambas Type : ft_LongDouble/ GB_T_FLOAT
DDL Value : BIGINT, INT8

Database/Gambas Type : ft_Long/ GB_T_INTEGER
DDL Value : INTEGER, INT, INT4

Database/Gambas Type : ft_Float/GB_T_FLOAT
DDL Value : DECIMAL, NUMERIC, REAL, FLOAT, FLOAT8, FLOAT4

Database/Gambas Type : ft_Date/GB_T_DATE
DDL Value : TIMESTAMP, DATETIME, DATE, TIME

Database/Gambas Type : ft_Double/GB_T_FLOAT
DDL Value : DOUBLE

Thanks go to Leo Seib for his SQLiteDataset library ( sqlitedataset.sourceforge.net)
which has been the base for my hacking.

The order for locating database files is:
1) If database is fullpath qualified
2) If Host is specified as a valid path
3) If set, GAMBAS_SQLITE_DBHOME variable
4) Current working directory.

The driver will look for databases in the current working directory unless the environment
variable GAMBAS_SQLITE_DBHOME is set.

There is no concept of users within sqlite.  Access is controlled by file permissions
on the database file. 

Creates database /tmp/sqlite.db by default.  For the gambas-database-manager this will
allow functionality.

Sqlite is not case sensative on table or field names.  The implementation for Gambas is. 

Database :memory: will load only in memory
