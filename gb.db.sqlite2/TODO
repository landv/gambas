Pragma table_info now shows fields in primary key 
field 'pk'. Maybe this feature can be used.

Aliases do not work - OK for for alias.field but not table alias.

Needs full testing and cleaning up.

THe psuedo user management needs to be thought about.

There may be functions that are provided by sqlitedataset that
I do not use, so could clean.

There may be issues with memory allocation that need investigation.

Version 3 of sqlite is imminent.
