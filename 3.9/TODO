TODO list: always incomplete :-)
--------------------------------

COMPILER

- Compilation error must always indicate the column, not sometimes only the line.

INTERPRETER

- A special syntax to make variable writable once only (for controls variables).
- Add global parameters for each component. Or no, a global configuration repository, to
  tell, for example, which socket the mysql component must use...
- Make objects printable, with a "_print" hidden method or something else.
- Make objects writable and readable to streams.
- Type mismatch error: print the mismatched values.
- Special runtime debugging commands for dumping all the variables for example.
- A new debugging compilation option to only put line number information in the output files.
- If project compilation version < compiler version then => compile all
- Catch kill signal to remove temporary files.
- Sorting two or more arrays at the same time.
- MOD with floats.
- Make the error information associated with the current stack frame.
- Timer.TimeLeft.
- OPEN ... LOCK. True lock while reading/writing a file.
- select() system call can fail if a watched file descriptor is in error. But how can I know
  the offending file descritor? Maybe by using poll() instead.
- Find a way to optimize the &= operator.

DEBUGGER

- Add/Remove a breakpoint without pausing the program!

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

- Manage Object properties in IDE.
- Make a visual control clipboard.
- Generates an index control->component to suggest components for missing controls.
- Be able to open a .tar.gz project, and compress it back when the project is closed.
- Conditional breakpoints.
- Define a control order somewhere for the toolbox.
- An option to interpret "." and "," when reading float in a CSV import.
- Class template files.
- Redesign the source code navigator (F2 and SHIFT+F2).
