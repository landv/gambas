<h1>Molly Malone</h1>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>1.</b></font>
In Dublin's fair city,<br/>
Where girls are so pretty,<br/>
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone,<br/>
As she pushed her wheelbarrow<br/>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br/>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh"!
</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i></p>
<p>
Alive, alive oh! alive, alive oh!<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh"!
</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>2.</b></font>
Now she was a fishmonger,<br>
And sure t'was no wonder,<br>
For so were her mother and father before,<br>
And they each wheeled their barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh"!
</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i></p>
<p>
<font size="+1"><b>3.</b></font>
She died of a fever,<br>
And no one could save her,<br>
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone.<br>
Now her ghost wheels her barrow,<br>
Through streets broad and narrow,<br>
Crying, "Cockles and mussels, alive, alive oh"!
</p>
<p><i>Chorus</i></p>
