  <li>$(ROOT) was replaced by $(DESTDIR) in the configuration script.
  <li>Components information files are now created by each component source
  directory.
  <li>autoconf was duped so that source package archive use symbolic links.
  <li>Use more symbolic links, so that source package is reduced.
  <li>Components can have a gambas part. Just add a gambas project inside the
  'src' sub-directory, having the same name as the component.
  </ul>
  <p><font><b>Development Environment</b></font>
  <ul>
  <li>Now control coordinates are stored as a multiple of Desktop.Scale in the

  font. THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL! BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR PROJECTS!
  <li>The grid size is always set to Desktop.Scale.

  <li>BUG: You cannot embed TRY statements anymore.
  <li>A new instruction, ERROR, that prints an error message on the

  <ul>
  <li>New API GB.RealFileName(): It does the same thing as GB.FileName() except
  that if the file is located inside the project executable, then a
  temporary copy is made, and the path to this copy is returned. Use it when
  you can't read data from memory with GB.LoadFile().
  <li>Now FOR EACH uses internal iterators. A container class can now fix its
  currently used iterators when deleting its elements. This avoids crashing
  the interpreter as before.
  <li>A new class, Enum, that represents internal iterators.
  <li>BUG: Collection now check all its iterators when deleting its elements.
  <li>Components written in gambas and executables are now read by using mmap().
  <li>GB.LoadFile() now uses mmap() if possible, so that loading resources from
  the executable is faster.
  <li>BUG: All Array indexes are converted to integers now, not just the first
  one.
  <li>Split() escape string parameter behavior has changed. Now it just one
  escape character only. If the escape string has two characters, then the
  first is the starting escape character and the second the ending one.
  <li>File.Dir(), File.Ext(), File.Name() and File.BaseName() all take a new
  optional parameter. If it is used, then instead of returning their
  corresponding path part, they replace it with the new parameter.
  For example, File.Name("/home/benoit", "gambas") returns "/home/gambas".
  <li>If the interpreter stops just after a non catched error, it does not print
  memory warning messages anymore.
  <li>A new function, Week, that returns the week number from a date.
  <li>A new function, DFree(), the returns the space available on a device.
  <li>A new property, List.Max, that returns List.Count - 1.
  <li>BUG: Milliseconds are not stripped anymore in dates, and is correctly
  managed when converting from/to a string.
  <li>BUG: _call() method should work in any case now.
  <li>BUG: IsPunct() now returns FALSE for non-ascii characters.

  <li>A new property, Desktop.Scale, that returns half the height of the default
  system font.
  <li>Two new methods, Control.MoveScaled() and Control.ResizeScaled() that
  multiply their arguments by Desktop.Scale and pass them to respectively
  Control.Move() and Control.Resize().
  <li>Font does not have its own resolution anymore. It always keep the screen
  resolution.
  <li>The TrayIcon control was implemented. Just put it on a form, and you
  get a little cute icon in the system tray. Thanks Daniel! :-)
  <li>BUG: Draw.Image() now works on devices having a mask.
  <li>DrawingArea paint events were optimized.
  <li>BUG: Embedded windows now internally create an hidden menu bar to store
  its menus.
  <li>BUG: Some fixes in the management of Mask and Picture properties.

  <li>WARNING! The bytecode has changed. You must entirely recompile your projects.
  <li>Now components disabled by libraries and includes detection are not compiled
  anymore.
  <li>A new configure flag, '--disable-qt-translation', prevents the qt component for
  using qt translation files, in the hope of helping to solve the 'freeze' problem
  with distributions like SuSE.
  </ul>

  <li>Support for Long and Single datatypes.
  <li>The syntax of EXEC, SHELL and RAISE has changed. They do not use the AS keyword
  anymore, but the assignment syntax:
    hProcess = EXEC ...
    hProcess = SHELL ...
    bCancel = RAISE ...
  The OPEN instruction may follow the same way in the future.
  </ul>

  <li>Two new datatypes: Long, a 64 bits integer, and Single, a 4 bytes floating point
  number.
  <li>Two new array classes: Long[] and Single[].
  <li>Support for files larger than 2 GB. Now Lof() and Seek() return a 64-bits Long
  value.
  <li>Two new keywords, LOCK and UNLOCK, to lock and unlock opened files.
  Just type LOCK #hFile or UNLOCK #hFile.
  <li>The Stat() function now returns an object of the class 'Stat', not 'File' anymore.
  <li>BUG: Fixed a possible crash when freeing classes at program end.
  <li>BUG: Some fixes in the management of components written in Gambas.
  <li>BUG: The Seek() function should work now.
  <li>BUG: A file descriptor leak was fixed in an internal function used by the
  Settings class.

  object automagically creates an hidden instance.
