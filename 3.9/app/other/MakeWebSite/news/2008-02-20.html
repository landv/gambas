Release of Gambas 2.1
<p>
Gambas finally runs on 64 bits system! Gambas bytecode can be run indifferently on a 32 bits or 64 bits architecture,
unless you use the Pointer datatype. In that case, you must recompile the project. 
This design flaw will be fixed on Gambas 3.
<p>
Otherwise, the main changes are the follwoing:
<li>Support for making component packages in the IDE, except for Ubuntu and Debian.</li>
<li>Gambas should compile on OpenBSD.</li>
<li>Help was updated.</li>
<p>
There are many bug fixes in the interpreter, <tt>gb.qt</tt>, <tt>gb.gtk</tt>, and so on.
Read the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> as usual for more information.
