Thanks to Ê¢Å (Liang Wei) tests, the bits manipulation functions now work correctly.
<p>
This release fixes these other bugs:
<ul>
  <li>The tray icons are correctly refreshed when the icon has changed.
  <li>The interpreter is now linked with the thread library on Linux systems.
  <li>When opening a project in the IDE, the packager information is correctly reset.
  <li>The simplified chinese translation has been completed.
</ul>
<p>P.S.: donkeys do not really like carrots. They prefer stale bread!
