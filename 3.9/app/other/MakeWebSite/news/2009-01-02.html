Some things were broken, so this release fixes them:
<ul>
  <li>The HttpClient.Async and FtpClient.Async properties.
  <li>The Balloon class, that was freezing the GUI.
  <li>The XSLT.Transform() method.
</ul>
<p>There are other bug fixes. Look at the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for them.
