Release of Gambas 1.9.35

I continue my work on the Development Environment in this release.
But you get two important bug fixes in the interpreter too!
<p>
<ul>
  <li>The Development Environment Find dialog was redesigned.
  <li>The automatic completion is less aggressive.
  <li>A form can be reloaded.
  <li>Reading and writing a string into a stream without specifying the length now work correctly. 
  <li>Temporary files are now correctly removed when the interpreter terminates.
  <li>The GTK component got a GridView control.
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for other bug fixes and changes.
