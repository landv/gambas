Release of Gambas 1.9.34

The development environment got a new look, based on KDE Crystal icon set. 
I even made <a href="screenshots.html">screenshots</a>!.
I hope you will like it. :-)
<p>
Less cosmetics changes are:
<ul>
  <li>The support of <i>actions</i>, that allows you to link buttons, menus and some
  controls acting together.
  <li>A new instruction, SLEEP, to wait without calling the event loop.
  <li>Two interpreter crashing bugs were fixed.
  <li>Many little changes in the <tt>gb.qt</tt> component.
</ul>
<p>
Oops. I forgot... <b>The bytecode has changed! You must recompile all your projects!</b>
