An article on a project made with Gambas in a french computing newspaper
You must carefully <a href="article-01-info-25-03-2010.jpg">read it</a> to find the shrimp! Sorry, but it's in french.
<p>
That application is based on <a href="http://gambasdoc.org/help/app/guygle?view">Guygle</a>, a Gambas project that I'm making for my boss.
It is written with the development version of Gambas 3.
