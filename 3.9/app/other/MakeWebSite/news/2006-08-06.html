Release of Gambas 1.9.37

The Stock class design has been completed. Consequently, the development
environment now takes a <a href="2006-08-06.png" target="_blank">GNOME look</a>
if it runs under GNOME, and a KDE look if it runs under KDE!
<p>
The project creation dialog has been redesigned, in the aim of being
less cluttered.
<p>
A crashing bug has been fixed in the interpreter too.
<p>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for the other bug fixes and changes.
<p>
<b>WARNING:</b> The automatic icon theme feature is experimental, so if it does not 
work on your system, tell me where your KDE and GNOME system icons are located!
