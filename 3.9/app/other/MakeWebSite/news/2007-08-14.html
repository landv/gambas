Release of Gambas 1.9.50
<p>
A big work was done on <tt>gb.gtk</tt> so that it reaches the same level
of features as <tt>gb.qt</tt>. The job is not finished, but many applications
can already run with both components.
<p>
The other main changes are:
<ul>
  <li>Support for autotools packages of Gambas projects.
  <li>Some new examples.
  <li>A new property that makes the running program a daemon.
  <li>Important bug fixes in the database drivers and the <tt>gb.net.smtp</tt> components.
  <li>The enhanced standard dialogs were moved from <tt>gb.form</tt> to their own <tt>gb.form.dialog</tt> component
      so that they are optional.
</ul>
<p>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for more details and bug fixes.
