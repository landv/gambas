Release of Gambas 2.20
<p>This release fixes a lot of bugs in the interpreter, the development environment, the GUI components...
Most noteworthy are:
<ul>
  <li>The Debian and Ubuntu packaging should work correctly now.
  <li>RDir() handles too long paths correctly.
  <li>The CR / NL input conversion flags is cleared when initializing a serial port.
  <li>Using <tt>gb.desktop</tt> made the interpreter crash at exit in some cases.
  <li>In <tt>gb.qt</tt>, TreeView.Count and ColumnView.Count now return the number of items in the view like in <tt>gb.gtk</tt>, not just the number of root items. 
  <li>ComboBox now raises the Click event when it gets its first element, because that element is automatically selected.
</ul>
Beware that the two previous changes may introduce a little backward incompatibility in your projects!
<p>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for the details.
