Gambas is now on SubVersion!

I finally put the development source code on SubVersion. To get a snapshot of the current
development version, you must do:
<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gambas/2.0/trunk/
</pre>
I will make tags for next releases, and to get them you will have to do:
<pre>$ svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gambas/2.0/tags/1.9.XX/
</pre>
To get a write access to the subversion repository, you must have an account on SourceForge,
and then give me your user name, so that I add you to the list of developers.
<p>You must of course be a true developer, and know how to use SubVersion!
