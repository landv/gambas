Release of Gambas 1.9.36

I put the debugger in the <tt>gb.debug</tt> component. This way the interpreter
is a little smaller, and I can add features to the debugger without making it
heavyier.
<p>
Otherwise, there are some little changes in the Development Environment, and
the Stock class design has been finalized.
<p>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for other bug fixes and changes.

<b>P.S.:</b> my flat was burglared the last week-end. My computer was safe, but they
stole, among other things, a laptop lended by my boss for my job, and my flute! 
Bad luck :-(
