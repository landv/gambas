Release of Gambas 1.9.46

<b>WARNING!</b> The bytecode, the LINK and LOCK instructions syntax have changed.
Projects must be updated and recompiled.
<p>
Otherwise, the main changes are:
<ul>
<li>The IDE supports projects managed by Subversion, but not CVS yet.
<li>The debugger was redesigned.
<li>Controls have a Name property now. Old VB users will be happy. :-)
<li>And tons of bug fixes as usual...
</ul>
See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for the details.
