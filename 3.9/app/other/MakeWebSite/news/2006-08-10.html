Release of Gambas 1.9.38

The main changes in the IDE are:
<ul>
<li>A new class, Balloon, that works like the Message class, but 
displays a yellow balloon instead! :-)
<li>The project creation dialog was redesigned again, and should work now.
<li>Making an executable uses a new dialog, with an option to make
a desktop shortcut of your application automatically.
</ul>
<p>
Three important bugs were fixed in the interpreter, one in the archiver,
and many others in the <tt>gb.qt</tt> component. The Stock class should
work everywhere now.

See the <a href="changelog2.html">ChangeLog</a> for the complete list of
all bug fixes and changes.
