Release of Gambas 1.9.42

<b>WARNING!</b> This release has many changes in the <tt>gb.qt</tt> component 
and <tt>gb.settings</tt> that will break your projects:
<ul>
  <li>The Dialog.Filter syntax is now the same as the gb.form FileChooser
  control.
  <li>All Mode properties now uses the constants from the Select class. 
  Other selection mode constants have been removed.
  <li>IconView GridX and GridY properties have been replaced by the 
  GridWidth and GridHeight properties.
  <li>HBox, VBox, HPanel and VPanel have an AutoResize property now, which
  is not set by default, contrary to the old behaviour.
  <li>The Settings class now stores Window and SidePanel settings 
  differently. This will mainly break the saved positions of IDE windows.
</ul>
Otherwise, there are some enhancements in the IDE:
<ul>
  <li>Optimizations in project loading.
  <li>Support for symbolic links.
  <li>A better translation dialog, thanks to Charlie Reinl.
</ul>
And you get a new DateChooser calendar control!
