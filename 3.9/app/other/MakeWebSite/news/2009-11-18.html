Release of Gambas 2.18
<p>That release includes the following main changes and bug fixes:
<ul>
  <li>The IDE now has support for the Ukrainian language.
  <li>The IDE does not sometimes freeze anymore when running a project.
  <li>Native windows are now disabled with GTK+ 2.18, so that the GTK+ component works correctly on recent distributions (Ubuntu 9.10, Mandriva 2010.0, and so on).
