* BUG: Now a too big children element is clipped if it is the first one listed
  after the fixed ones (no more infinite loop)
* NEW: ReportUnit module is merged with Report class. All functions for convertion
  are now available as static functions in Report. The two internal functions scale and
  internal width are now public function of report instance.
* NEW: Return of the ReportImage and ReportSvgImage with no change for now.
* NEW: Continue to improve the ReportGridView widget ... really not ready for use.
* NEW: Restore the UseField property in ReportLabel so for now the component is
