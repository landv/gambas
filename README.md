# Gambas Almost Means BASIC

GAMBAS is a free implementation of a graphical development environment 
based on a BASIC interpreter and a full development platform. It is very 
inspired by Visual Basic and Java.

Go to http://gambas.sourceforge.net to get more information: how to compile 
and install it, where to find binary packages, how to report a bug...

Go to http://gambaswiki.org for the language documentation.

The following pieces of code were borrowed and adapted:

- The natural string comparison algorithme was adapted from the algorithm 
  made by Martin Pol. See http://sourcefrog.net/projects/natsort/ for more 
  details.

- The hash table implementation was adapted from the glib one.

- The HTML entities parsing in gb.gtk comes from KHTML sources.

- The gb.image.effect sources are adapted from KDE 3 image effect routines.

- The gb.clipper library embeds the Clipper library. See
  http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper.php for mode details.

- The function that computes the easter day of a specific year uses an
  algorithm made by Aloysius Lilius And Christophorus Clavius.

- The blurring algoritm is based on the 'StackBlur' algorithm made by Mario Klingemann.
  See http://incubator.quasimondo.com/processing/fast_blur_deluxe.php for more details.

If I forget some borrowed code in the list above, just tell me.

Enjoy Gambas!
