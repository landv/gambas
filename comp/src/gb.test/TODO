 * Integration into the IDE with bells and whistles and a command-line tool for automated testing
 * Compiler and interpreter support for test classes (list them), fixtures and data files (do not include them in installable packages)
 * Internal and external (wiki) documentation, test how-to
 * Test ourselves, including how well we interface with other TAP software

 * More assertion convenience functions, use diagnotic messages to detail test failures for the user (Test::Differences in perl5)
 * Subtest support (see http://search.cpan.org/~exodist/Test-Simple-1.302136/lib/Test/More.pm)
    * Where is that in the TAP specification? Can they be nested arbitrarily?

 * Get us listed on https://testanything.org
