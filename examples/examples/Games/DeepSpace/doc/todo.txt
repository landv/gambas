Things that need to be finished or started.

    - object collision.  i removed the old object collision cause it
      sucked.  new collision code needs to be written which includes
      elastic collisions so asteroids that bump eachother or the ship
      will around
      
    - some kind of asteroids style game as an example of what
      this little engine is for
      
    - write bot ai, so there is an opponent for everyone to fight
    
    - single bullet fire mode, not full on automatic
    - network play mode, where players can fight head to head
    - more stuff i havent thought of
