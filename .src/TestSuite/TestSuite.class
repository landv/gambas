''' The TestSuite class represents a suite of different tests to be run.  The TestSuite contains
''' a part-whole hierarchy of objects that implement the ITest interface --
''' including TestCase objects and other TestSuite objects.  Executing the Run method for the
''' TestSuite will execute all test cases that it contains.  The TestSuite class also provides
''' methods for add all test cases contained in a test container object into the suite.
