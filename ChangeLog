* Components information files are now created by each component source
  directory.
* autoconf was duped so that source package archive use symbolic links.
* Use more symbolic links, so that source package is reduced.
* Components can have a gambas part. Just add a gambas project inside the
  'src' sub-directory, having the same name as the component.

DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

* Now control coordinates are stored as a multiple of Desktop.Scale in the
  form files. This way, the size of the dialogs is proportional to the system

  one.
* Split() escape string parameter behavior has changed. Now it just one
  escape character only. If the escape string has two characters, then the
  first is the starting escape character and the second the ending one.
* File.Dir(), File.Ext(), File.Name() and File.BaseName() all take a new
  optional parameter. If it is used, then instead of returning their
  corresponding path part, they replace it with the new parameter.
  For example, File.Name("/home/benoit", "gambas") returns "/home/gambas".
* If the interpreter stops just after a non catched error, it does not print
  memory warning messages anymore.

  multiply their arguments by Desktop.Scale and pass them to respectively
  Control.Move() and Control.Resize().
* Font does not have its own resolution anymore. It always keep the screen
  resolution.
* The TrayIcon control was implemented. Just put it on a form, and you
  get a little cute icon in the system tray. Thanks Daniel! :-)
* BUG: Draw.Image() now works on devices having a mask.
* DrawingArea paint events were optimized.

* CREATE tells that a class is auto-creatable, i.e. that using the class like a
  object automagically creates an hidden instance.
* When a project has exported class, the compiler automatically generates a '.list'
  file containing the list of exported classes, and a '.info' file that describes
  these exported classes. The format of these file is the same as those generated
  by the 'gbi' tool for native components.
* Support for _put and _get methods.

  for components that need it.
