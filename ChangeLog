  directory.
* autoconf was duped so that source package archive use symbolic links.
* Use more symbolic links, so that source package is reduced.
* Components can have a gambas part. Just add a gambas project inside the
  'src' sub-directory, having the same name as the component.

  one.
* Split() escape string parameter behavior has changed. Now it just one
  escape character only. If the escape string has two characters, then the
  first is the starting escape character and the second the ending one.
* File.Dir(), File.Ext(), File.Name() and File.BaseName() all take a new
  optional parameter. If it is used, then instead of returning their
  corresponding path part, they replace it with the new parameter.
  For example, File.Name("/home/benoit", "gambas") returns "/home/gambas".

  multiply their arguments by Desktop.Scale and pass them to respectively
  Control.Move() and Control.Resize().
* Font does not have its own resolution anymore. It always keep the screen
  resolution.

  object automagically creates an hidden instance.
* When a project has exported class, the compiler automatically generates a '.list'

* Support for _put and _get methods.

  files for all native components.

  interpreter. Note that configuration files are now stored under ~/.config/gambas
  and that their format has changed to the Windows INI file format.
