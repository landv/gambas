** IMPORTANT NOTES

Before installing gb.corba, compiling it and then complaining, please read the
following remarks CAREFULLY! 
To compile gb.corba, you must install the following packages on your system : 
 - The omniORB4 core. 
 - The libomniorb4
 - The libomniorb4-dev
 - The libomniorb4-nameserver

** HOW TO COMPILE GB.CORBA ?

1) First, check that you installed all the needed development packages

2) Copy the gb.corba dir in to gambas directory.
  
3) When done, type the following magic sentences in a shell.
   '#' represents your shell prompt, and "..." are the
   messages printed during the configuration and compilation.

  This command analyzes the system and configure the package:

     # ./configure
     ...

   This command compiles the programs:

     # make
     ...

   And finally this command installs everything:

     # su -c "make install"
     Password: <Type the root password here>
     ...

   If something fails during this process, try to type the
   following command before ./configure :

     # ./reconf

   If it does not work, I need to know what happened exactly.
   To do so, type the following command :

     # ( ./configure; make; make install ) > output.txt 2>&1

   And send me the file "output.txt" by mail, with every other
   detail about your computer and your distribution you find
   useful.
3) If everything was fine, type "gambas" to run the development
   environment. There are an example in the "gambas-examples"
   directory.

Enjoy it !

Carlo.
