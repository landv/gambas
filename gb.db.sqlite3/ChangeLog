           a) If fullpath given then use this.
           b) If Host variable set, then look at the path set in the variable.

- By default, an in-memory database is opened if no database name is specified.
- An in_memory database returns as user-list only the current user, with admin rights.
- The databases are not searched by default in the current working directory anymore. 
  Instead, they are searched in the /tmp/gambas.%pid%/sqlite/ directory.

- Many clean-ups in database_create(). The function FullPath() is not necessary
  anymore, and has been removed.
- Fix table_index() so that it returns error if no true primary key is found
  in the table.
