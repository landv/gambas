HOW TO CREATE BINARY PACKAGES FOR GAMBAS
----------------------------------------

This file won't explain you how to make the packages, but the structure they
must follow.

Gambas *must* be packaged the way described in this document, because the
development environment relies on this structure when it creates a package 
of a gambas project.

If a distribution does not follow this requirement, then the packages 
generated by the development environment won't be able to be installed, 
and the user will be very unhappy.

Not all distributions make correct gambas binary packages at the moment. 
So, if you are a packager from these distributions, and if you read this 
text, please try to help Gambas work on your distribution.

Thanks in advance,

Beno√Æt.


SPECIFICATIONS FOR GAMBAS 1.0.x
-------------------------------

Gambas binary packages must follow the following names and contents:

**** THE RUNTIME PACKAGE ****

This package includes the Gambas interpreter needed to run Gambas 
applications.

It contains:
- The interpreter (gbx)
- The informer (gbi)
- The internal component description (lib.gb.component, gb.info and 
  gb.list)
- The readme files, TODO files, and so on.

Its name must be 'gambas-runtime'

**** THE COMPONENT PACKAGES ****

Each gambas component must have its own package.

The package of a component contains:
- The shared library files (*.so, *.la)
- The component file (*.component)
- The information file (*.info and *.list)

Then name of a component package MUST BE 'gambas-gb-XXX' where 'gb-XXX' is 
the name of the component, where the point were replaced by a minus sign.

For example, the gb.qt.ext component package name is 'gambas-gb-qt-ext'.


SPECIFICATIONS FOR GAMBAS 1.9.x (NOT DEFINITIVE!)
-------------------------------------------------

At the moment, the specifications are almost the same, except that 
'lib.XXX.component' files were renamed as 'XXX.component', and that now
a component can have a part written in Gambas.

Gambas binary packages must follow the following name and contents:

**** THE RUNTIME PACKAGE ****

This package includes the Gambas interpreter needed to run Gambas 
applications.

It contains:
- The interpreter (gbx2)
- The internal component description (gb.component, gb.info and 
  gb.list)
- The readme files, TODO files, and so on.

gb.la, gb.so, gb.so.0 and gb.so.0.0.0 do not need to be distributed,
they are used for generating gb.info and gb.list only.

Its name must be 'gambas-runtime'

**** THE DEVELOPMENT PACKAGE ****

This package includes all tools needed to compile Gambas projects without
having to install the complete development environment.

It contains:
- The compiler (gbc2)
- The archiver (gba2)
- The informer (gbi2)

Its name must be 'gambas-dev'.

**** THE COMPONENT PACKAGES ****

Each gambas component must have its own package.

The package of a component contains:
- The shared library files (gb.XXX.la, gb.XXX.so, gb.XXX.so.0, 
  gb.XXX.so.0.0.0)
- The component file (gb.XXX.component)
- The information file (gb.XXX.info and gb.XXX.list)
- Sometimes a part written in Gambas (gb.XXX.gambas)

...where 'gb.XXX' is the name of the component

Then name of a component package MUST BE 'gambas-gb-XXX' where 'gb-XXX' is 
the name of the component, where the point were replaced by a minus sign.

For example, the gb.qt component package name is 'gambas-gb-qt'. 
It must include:
- gb.qt.la
- gb.qt.so

- The help files

It requires:

- The components packages needed by the IDE and the database manager

Its name must be 'gambas-ide'. It depends on 'gambas-runtime', 'gambas-dev'
and all needed components packages.
