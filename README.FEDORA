README FOR FEDORE CORE 3 & 4 USERS
-------------------------------------

From IceZ Cube <icezcube@yahoo.com>:

I have successfully compile gambas in Fedora Core 4.
The problem - Fedora Core 4 installed with gcc4

Tips/Tricks:

Before compiling do :-

    a)  yum install compat-gcc-32

    b)  export CC=gcc32

This workaround was from Fedoranews.org.
