COMPONENT DIRECTORY TEMPLATE

Here you will find the 'make-component' script, that creates a initial 
component source directory from a configuration file located in the 
'conf' directory.

BE CAREFUL! This template only works inside the complete gambas source 
package structure.

For example, let suppose you want to make a component named 'gb.test',
based on the well known 'test' library:

1) Copy the file 'TEMPLATE.conf' in the 'conf' directory, and rename it
   as 'gb.test.conf'
   
2) Open a terminal, with the current directory being the one where
   the 'make-component' script is located. This is important, because
   otherwise the script won't work.
   
3) Edit the file 'gb.test.conf', and replaces the value of each
   '#define' directive by the appropriate ones. Each directive has
   a commentary that explains its role.
   
4) Once done, run './make-component gb.test'.

5) If everything is ok, you will find a new component directory in the
   parent directory named gb.test, with all needed files and symbolic
   links ready to be build: configure.ac, Makefile.am, ...
   
If something is weird, tell me on the gambas developer mailing-list!
