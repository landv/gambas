TODO list: always incomplete :-)
--------------------------------

VERSION 2.0
-----------

- A stack that can grow dynamically.
- A special syntax to make variable writable once only (for controls variables).
- Doing something like ByRef to help porting VB projects.

- Refine the contents of *.component files.
- Add global parameters for each component.
- Compilation error must indicate the column, not only the line.
- Make objects printable, with a "_print" hidden method or something else.
- Make objects writable and readable to streams.
- Perl regexp with the MATCH operator.
- Temporary files should not be readable by everyone.
- An expression can begin with NEW.

Don't do it:

- OPTIONAL arguments should takes any expression.
- Class synonymous.
- Array[x] when x < 0 should return Array[Array.Count - x]
- NEW Collection OF String

Do it asap:

- Enhance archive format.
- Trim$(sStr, "pattern", " ", "/")
  -> RTrim(sStr, "WHERE") or RTrim(sStr, " ", "\n")
- If project compilation version < compiler version then => compile all
- CREATE STATIC & CREATE PRIVATE
- Split() should manage double escape characters.
