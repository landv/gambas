TODO list: always incomplete :-)
--------------------------------

VERSION 2.0
-----------

- A stack that can grow dynamically.
- A special syntax to make variable writable once only (for controls variables).
- Doing something like ByRef to help porting VB projects.

- Add global parameters for each component.
- Compilation error must indicate the column, not only the line.
- Make objects printable, with a "_print" hidden method or something else.
- Make objects writable and readable to streams.
- Perl regexp with the MATCH operator.
- An expression can begin with NEW.
- Type mismatch error: print the mismatched values.
- Special runtime debugging commands for dumping all the variables for example.
- A new debugging compilation option to only put line number information in the output files.

Don't do it:

- OPTIONAL arguments should takes any expression.
- Class synonymous.
- Array[x] when x < 0 should return Array[Array.Count - x]
- NEW Collection OF String

Do it asap:

- Trim$(sStr, "pattern", " ", "/")
  -> RTrim(sStr, "WHERE") or RTrim(sStr, " ", "\n")
- If project compilation version < compiler version then => compile all
- Module methods should not be public by default.
- Full stack trace on errors.
- Intercept all signals in Application_Signal.
- Object.SetVariable, or SetSymbol, and that can act on static things.

-----------------------

- .startup file, a copy of .project with only startup info inside.
- .project files should be marked as 2.0.
- Renaming controls in the IDE renames the source code too.
- Loading a "form" component needs calling InitControl on classes that are not
  member of the list of controls.

- Manage Object properties in IDE.
- Put a language code in comments, and hide them as needed by the user.
- Make a visual control clipboard.
- Packager should manage component projects.
- Fix the global search when it starts on a data file.
- A new folder for non-packaged data files ('Notes' ?).

- ListBox should raise Click event even if the user clicks on an
  already selected item.
- Adds automatically the extension to the file in the save file dialog.
