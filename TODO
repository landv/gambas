TODO list: always incomplete :-)
--------------------------------

VERSION 2.0
-----------

- A stack that can grow dynamically.
- A special syntax to make variable writable once only (for controls variables).
- Add global parameters for each component.
- Compilation error must indicate the column, not only the line.
- Make objects printable, with a "_print" hidden method or something else.
- Make objects writable and readable to streams.
- Perl regexp with the MATCH operator.
- An expression can begin with NEW.
- Type mismatch error: print the mismatched values.
- Special runtime debugging commands for dumping all the variables for example.
- A new debugging compilation option to only put line number information in the output files.
- NInstr() -> Count the number of patterns.

Don't do it:

- OPTIONAL arguments should takes any expression.
- Class synonymous.
- Array[x] when x < 0 should return Array[Array.Count - x]
- NEW Collection OF String

Do it asap:

- If project compilation version < compiler version then => compile all
- Intercept all signals in Application_Signal.
- Object.SetVariable, or SetSymbol, and that can act on static things.
- Structure support
- Callback support
- Sorting two or more arrays at the same time.
- Creates error objects for each error and not one for all.
