STANDARD FORMAT FOR COMMIT MESSAGES
-----------------------------------

This message is for Laurent, Daniel, and all people that will have a write 
access to the svn repository in the future.

I want to have a standard way to write commit messages, so that ChangeLog can 
be almost automatically generated.

The format is the following:

* A ChangeLog slot, between '[' & ']'
* A ChangeLog modification: a '*', a space, the word 'BUG','NEW' or 'OPT', a 
colon, a space, and the text.

'BUG' for a fix, 'NEW' for a new feature, and 'OPT' for an optimization.

Slots are the name of the component, in uppercase if possible, or some other 
slots like [INTERPRETER], [COMPILER]...

All lines must be lower or equal than 76 characters.

If a changelog modification is more than one line, you must use a two space 
indent.

Void lines are ignored.

All other lines won't go into the changelog.

For example:

--8<-----------
I did this thing, and this won't go into the changelog.

[GB.QT]
* BUG: I fixed this bug.
* NEW: I made this very long modification....
Â  and it takes more than one line to write it.

This won't go into the changelog too.

[GB.SDL]
* BUG: What an awful bug!

[GB.GTK]
* NEW: I finally finished the component :-)

--8<-----------

It would be cool to follow this scheme. I will start at my next commit.
