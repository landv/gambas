some functions for users is not implemented.(ex:user_info ... etc)
the ...DataBase.create(" ... ") don't work !!!!
to create a database, use the open() function if the database don't exist automatically created.
to drop DataBase 1) open this Database 2) use ...DataBase.Remove(... full path + name
 of the DataBase opened ex:/var/lib/firebird2/data/MyDataBase.fdb ...) !!!! case sensitive!!!!
to compile this package firebird-dev and ibpp 2.4... library is need.
you can download ibpp from www.ibpp.org.
(if you want to use ibpp 2.3.5 (not <), go to the code and change all int64_t in long int)
